Complex multiplication is a property some elliptic curves have. An elliptic curve $E$ can be defined to be the zero locus of a degree $3$ polynomial in two variables having no singularities.
Drawing an elliptic curve $E$ on a real plane has its limitations, since the picture we obtain depends on the particular equation $E$ verifies.
If we allow complex numbers and instead embed it in the complex projective plane then $E$ is now isomorphic to a complex torus, a genus 1 compact surface.\par
Moreover, one can define through a geometrical construction a law group on $E$ making it an abelian group. In abelian groups one can consider the multiplication-by-$n$ endomorphisms defined by $P\mapsto nP$. 
In the case of most elliptic curves, there are no other endomorphisms i.e. the endomorphism ring $\End(E)$ is isomorphic to $\Z$. Then $E$ has complex multiplication (CM) if $\End(E)$ is stricly larger than $\Z$. The ring $\End(E)$ is then also an special kind of ring i.e. an order $\OO$ of a quadratic imaginary field $K$.\par
There is a quantity attached to every elliptic curve that tells us whether two curves are $\C$-isomorphic or not, the $j$-invariant. In the case that $E$ has CM its $j$-invariant is an algebraic number over $\Q$.\par
Every order $\OO$ has an associated proper ideal class group $\Cl(\OO)$ and a ring class field $K_f$, and both are constructed in terms of elliptic curves having CM by $\OO$. The main theorem of CM shows that the Galois group of $K_f$ over $K$ is $\Cl(\OO)$. Since $\Cl(\OO)$ is abelian this is an explicit construction of infinitely many finite abelian extensions of $K$. This solves partially - for the quadratic imaginary case - the main problem in class field theory, which is finding all the finite abelian extensions of a number field.\par
All of this requires showing that the $j$-invariants of elliptic curves with CM are algebraic over $\Q$. This last property is proven by using the fact that the modular curve $X_0(N)$ can be defined over $\Q$ and an alternative interpretation of $X_0(N)$ as a moduli space i.e. the curve $X_0(N)$ classifies the degree $N$ isogenies between elliptic curves. However, the first definition of $X_0(N)$ is geometrical.\par
In the same way a complex torus $T=\C/\Lambda$ is the quotient space when $\Lambda$ acts on the plane as a discrete group of isometries, the modular curve is also defined in geometrical terms\footnote{$\slg$ is also a discrete subgroup of isometries of the upper half plane $\uhp$ with the Poincar√© metric.}. It is the quotient space $X_0(N)=\uhp/\Gamma_0(N)$, where $\Gamma_0(N)$ is a carefully chosen finite index subgroup of $\slg$. \par
Finally, we discuss the construction of Heegner points, which we can think of as an application of the theory of complex multiplication. Together with the Modularity theorem, Kolyvagin, Gross and Zagier gave results closely related to the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, an open problem concerning elliptic curves.
